### 👋 Hey there!
I'm Matteo Hausner, a.k.a. [bwRavencl](https://bwravencl.de).

### 🧑‍💻 By day...
I'm a software developer with a master's degree in computer science.

### ✈️ Off the clock...
I'm passionate about all things flying - from simulators and RC planes to aviation history and space exploration.

### 🎮 My personal passion project is...
[ControllerBuddy](https://controllerbuddy.org), a game controller mapping tool crafted specifically for flight simulators. It's where my love for coding and flight intersect.

### 🌍 Outside of coding and flying...
I enjoy time with my fiancée, cuddle our cat, dive into history, jam to 80s rock and pop, enjoy ice skating, and geek out over computer history and open-source software.

### 📫 You can reach me...
Via the [official Discord](https://discord.gg/2Sg9ggZrAp) for anything ControllerBuddy-related, or by email for everything else.
